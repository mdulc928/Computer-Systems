# Lab 3

[Check Submission](https://protect.bju.edu/cps/checker/cps230/lab3)

## Overview

For this lab you will write C code to solve several bit-manipulation puzzles from your textbook.  Namely:

* 2.64: `any_odd_one`
* 2.66: `leftmost_one`
* 2.68: `lower_one_mask`

## Procedure

Use the [starting code](lab3.c).  Your job is to

* Fill out the function bodies (i.e., replace the `/* TODO */` comments)
* Add a few more tests for each function implemented (see the existing comments in the code for more)

Do not use loops or if / else statements in your solutions.  You do not need them.

## Hints

* 2.66 is the hardest of the 3; save it for last

## Report

Turn in the standard report formatted in markdown.  Remember, the report should include:

1. How many hours did you worked on the lab?
1. Did you encounter any problems and what were they?
1. If yes to the previous question, did you need help to resolve these problems?
1. What did you learn?

## Submission

Turn in:

* `report.md`
