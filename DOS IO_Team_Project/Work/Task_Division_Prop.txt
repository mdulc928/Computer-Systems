Tasks:
	Creating more tasks for us to use - Stone Champion
	Electives 
	 * Timer Preemption - Melchisedek Dulcio - Done
	 * PN Calculator Demo - Melchisedek Dulcio
	 * Graphics Demo - Stone Champion
	 * Music Demo - Stone Champion
 	 * Real Mode C - Stone Champion/Melchisedek Dulcio
		We just need to write something in real mode C.
		Maybe we can do our output of characters in C.
	 * Protected Mode - Stone Champion/Melchisedek Dulcio
	     so we have an issue:	
		If we do that one we can't do the timer
		Or we can write the timer and not use it
		So we would still get the points for the timer, I think.
	Fix Bugs - Start on Thursday.
	Polishing: 
	 * Comments - Whatever we wrote
	 * code golf - Whatever we wrote
	Other thoughts
	* If we do the PN Calculator, we would have to use the timer
	  since we are asking for input from the user and we don't want our
	  program to freeze.
