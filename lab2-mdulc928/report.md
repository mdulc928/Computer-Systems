Time Spent: 4 hours   

### Work Completed



I certify that I completed all the steps in the lab using my own computer.

#### Issues Met



**Scanf:** It took a couple minutes to figure out why my code was not running after my scanf(). I realized that it was my conditional statement that was wrong.


#### Known Issues



It may be my processor, but my code took a little longer to run than I expected though I was running the ".exe" file. 

#### Knowledge Acquired



I had to look up how to retrieve the ASCII int values from a character even though I knew how to output the value. Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6660145/convert-ascii-number-to-ascii-character-in-c. 

I borrowed the "do while" idea, not code, from my first search. Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6660145/convert-ascii-number-to-ascii-character-in-c. That is how I remembered that ASCII was actually the decimal representation the character. 

#### Transcripts
